Our privacy policy
•	Our App is designed to allow you and others to connect with each other in real time.
•	We use personal information to provide our services, to communicate about existing and new App features with you, and to comply with our terms and applicable laws.
•	We do not sell personal information.

To help users connect with people they know, we offer them the option to invite friends to join them on the App. To take advantage of this feature, users can opt in to share phone numbers from their address book as noted above, or add phone numbers manually.
•	Names of friends you choose to invite to join you on the App.
•	Conversations that Joint creators/members have in SotFeed joints. We temporarily record the content in all joints and retain it (along with a transcript) if a user or our automated systems flag a potential issue to us (in violation of our platform guidelines updated from time to time).

•	Communications that we exchange with users when they contact us with questions or feedback, including feedback about interacting with other users.
